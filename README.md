The Portable Ventilator, or P-Vent, is a low-cost ventilator I helped to create during the Covid-19 pandemic. Owned by a company I co-founded, Kepler Enterprises, LLC, the P-Vent is a device that costs 10x less than the average hospital ventilator, and can be used with any breathing bag in the field or in a hospital. The device was designed to free up the hands of medical field workers, as it is lightweight, easy to use, and can perform the same task of pumping the bag. The P-vent is even equipped with a pressure sensor, giving it more ability than a normal bag mask, as it can detect how the lungs are reacting to the air intake and adjust accordingly. A video of the project and a Github link to the now open-source code I started writing can be found below.
